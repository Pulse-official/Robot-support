# Introduction

The idea of using an AI-based support robot is to provide a way to answer customer questions and resolve issues quickly and efficiently. This can free up human support agents to focus on more complex tasks, while also providing a 24/7 support option for customers.

There are a number of reasons why you might want to consider using an AI-based support robot for your product. These include:

* **Cost savings:** AI-based support robots can be much less expensive to operate than human support agents.
* **Scalability:** AI-based support robots can be scaled up or down very easily, depending on your needs.
* **24/7 availability:** AI-based support robots are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
* **Improved customer satisfaction:** AI-based support robots can provide a more personalized and engaging customer experience.

# Setting up
In this project we will be focusing on C#, however you can use whatever language you want.\
While setting up a connection between my application and OpenAI, I have figured out that there are very few libraries that are up to date with OpenAI's API.\
As a result of that, we will be focusing on a homebrew solution.
